 I want to share some wholesome moments. When It was my birthday (Guild Leader) I got surprised with a screenshot they worked together on creating and a heart warming message. I'm so proud of this guild and Its members. Seeing them come togeher to do this  is truely amazing! We also came together to build outselfs a  Dragon hologram Generator for our guild hall!

And our amazing guildie Ears brought my joke alive for my birthday and blessed us with a drawing of the Skritt Queen as Queen Elizabeth!
