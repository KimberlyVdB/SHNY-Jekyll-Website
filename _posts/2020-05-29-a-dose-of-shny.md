A Skritt Invasion has terrorized Divinities Reach and other places in Tyria. Queen Jenna nearly lost her crown. Next time she wont be so lucky. I present to you screenshots from our skritt invasion and other guild activities. We also managed to craft the golden SAB frog but the skritt is still on top, if u look closely!
