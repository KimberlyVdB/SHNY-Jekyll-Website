What's been going on with the Skritt lately? We hosted our very first #Skrittstagram last month and it was a blast! Coming up with some fun screenshots in small groups surrounding a theme, sharing it with the rest after. Working together, talking together, laughing together! A fun evening on discord and in-game.

Of course we had more shenanigans, a month can't pass without it! Ill be sharing our screenshots below!

We also managed to get the Dragon holographic generator for the guild hall as a group effort!
