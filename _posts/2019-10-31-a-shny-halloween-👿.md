Halloween time, guild time 👻

We had a catwalk with a halloween(costume) theme, a Jp/race that ended us inside a cauldronto be cooked.Some skritt showed off their art skills as we  gave them a couple minute to draw a skritt getting fat in candy corn, and we tested their knowledge of the madking and halloween itself! End we ended the night with a lot if laughs and giggles as we played cards against humanity on discord until late.
