So, what have we been up to? Our discord server got some custom made emotes so now we can share some: skritt love, skritt stab and pogger. More to come in the future! Sorry Pepe, you will have to move over. Other then that ,our server now has some self assign roles to avoid spamming people for no reason so were fancier now!

We had a seasonal event a while ago so our guildies made some amazing art pieces! True artists. Theme was "Skritt surfing on a wave of shinies!". Behold!
