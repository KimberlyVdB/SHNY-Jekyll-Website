Since last time we held an easter party in the guild hall with a runway, race/jp, quiz and ofc another drawing contest for the giggles. Ending the evening with laughs in drawfull since cards against humanity wasnt available.

We held a spring screenshot contest, the winners screenshot will grace our fashion wars page soon! And ofc some more skritt shenanigans and april fools
