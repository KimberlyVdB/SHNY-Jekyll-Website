    <h3>Aventure Tuesday?</h3>

    <p>Event night? Event night!
      Yes on fridays we play diffrent things it can be dungeons, bounties, meta events,
      world boss runs etc. You get the point, we decide on something and do it.

    <p>Im sure you know what that is, its guild missions.</p>

    <h3>(Board)game night?</h3>

    <p>Once a month we orginize a game night.
      Completly unrelated to guild wars 2, hangout in discord and play something that can be
      cards against humanity, pictonairy, etc you name it we could play it!

    <h3>Seasonal guild events?</h3>

    <p>Halloween? Chrismas? Easter? any other excuse to throw a party?
      We'll take it! So a couple of times a year we hold events in the guild hall
      or differnt places. What do we do? Lots of diffrent things ingame and on discord.

      What we as a guild will exactly do, will vary.
