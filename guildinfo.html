    <h3>Fashion wars?</h3>

    <p>Yes we are PvE guild but also have love for fashion wars.
      This means we have channels on discord dedicated to our fashion/screenshot game.
      People that arent into the fashion are of course also welcome to join.
      Other then just share our screenshots we also hold fashion wars contests with a<span> diffrent theme every single
        time.</span>
      During seasonal guild events you can expect a run on the catwalk!</p>

    <h3>
      Casual raiding?</h3>

    <p>Yes we raid! We have experienced and not very experienced players.
      But as said we are casual even people that are completly new are allowed to join!
      Aslong as you know what you're doing with your class and have the right build/gear!

    <h3>Aventure Tuesday?
    </h3>

    <p>Event night? Event night!
      Yes on fridays we play diffrent things it can be dungeons, bounties, meta events,
      world boss runs etc. You get the point, we decide on something and do it.
      Its that simple and fun!

    <h3>Guild missions?</h3>

    <p>Im sure you know what that is, its guild missions.</p>

    <h3>(Board)game night?</h3>

    <p>Once a month we orginize a game night.
      Completly unrelated to guild wars 2, hangout in discord and play something that can be
      cards against humnaity, pictonairy, etc you name it we could play it!</p>

    <h3>Seasonal guild events?</h3>

    <p>Halloween? Chrismas? Easter? any other excuse to throw a party?
      We'll take it! So a couple of times a year we hold events in the guild hall
      or differnt places. What do we do? Lots of diffrent things ingame and on discord.
      Quizes, pictonairy, custom jps for that event? Why not!
      What we as a guild will exactly do, will vary.
