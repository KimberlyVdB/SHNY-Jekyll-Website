    <h2 class="titles">About A Skritt At Heart [SHNY] 🐀</h2>

    <p>We are a casual PvE guild with a focus on fashion wars. A small, friendly and social bunch of skritt.</p>

    <h3>Fashion wars?</h3>

    <p>Yes, we are a PvE guild, but we also have a love for fashion wars. This means we have channels on our Discord
      dedicated to our fashion/screenshot game. People that are not really into fashion are, of course, also welcome to
      join. Besides just sharing our screenshots we also hold fashion wars contests with a different theme every single
      time. During seasonal guild events you can also expect a run on the catwalk!</span>

    <h3>Aventure Tuesday?</h3>

    <p>Event night? Event night!
      Event night? Event night! Yes, on fridays we do various things, those can be dungeons, bounties, meta events,
      world boss runs and so on. You get the point, we decide on something and do it. It’s that simple and fun!
    </p>

    <h3>Guild Missions?</h3>

    <p>I’m sure you know what that is, it’s guild missions!</p>

    <h3>(Board)Game Night</h3>

    <p>Once a month, we organize a game night. Completely unrelated to guild Wars 2, we hang out in Discord and play
      something, that can be Cards Against Humanity, Pictionary or anything similar. You name it, we could play it!
      There’s also talk about starting an RPG tabletop night, lots of interested skritt but nothing started yet.</p>

    <h3>Seasonal Guild Events</h3>

    <p>Halloween? Christmas? Easter? Any other excuse to throw a party? We'll take it! So, a couple of times a year, we
      hold events in the guild hall or somewhere else. What do we do? Lots of different things, ingame and on Discord.
      Quizzes, Pictionary, custom JPs related to the event? Why not! What we, as a guild, will do exactly, is going to
      vary.
    </p>

    <h3>Skritt Invasion?</h3>

    <p> Get your skritt tonic ready, because it's time for an invasion, and not a single shiny person will be safe from
      the hoard of skritt. It’s time for us to hang out in Discord and chase people around, while also spending a fun
      evening together.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Casual Raiding?</h3>

    <p>It’s starting back up and will be casual as well as beginner friendly. Don’t expect full clears, it is meant to
      be fun for us as a guild. We are also beginning to form a static group with more experienced players.
    </p>

    <h3>Raid Static?</h3>
    <p>We have a static squad of experienced and relaxed players who are not after big numbers or speed clears. It's
      open for like-minded people that want to raid on a schedule!</p>

    <h3>Contests?</h3>
    <p>We hold contests on our Discord server, ranging from themed screenshots to funny (guild) names./p>

    <h3>Minecraft Server</h3>

    <p>
      SHNY has a Minecraft survival server for its guild members to play on whenever they want! Will you be our
      neighbour in our Minecraft town, or do you prefer exploring?
    </p>

    <h3>Animal Crossing?</h3>
    <p>Over time, it has been shown that we have a lot of players knee deep into ACNH. So what did we do? Start a
      channel all about it, where we share our turnip prices, friend codes, silly screenshots and so on.</p>
