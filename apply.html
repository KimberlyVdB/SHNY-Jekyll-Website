  <h3>Some things we're strict about are;</h3>

  <p>Racial, religious,sexual and/or any other type of discrimination will not be tolerated, even as jokes.
    Same goes for homophobia and transphobia.</p>
  <p>Don't engage in religious/political or sexual discussions. There is enough
    of that IRL.
    Don't be an ass.</p>

  <h3>Here you can read what is expected from guild members:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><span>Maturity and friendliness:</span> We're here to enjoy the game and there is no doubt there will be
      silly moments.
      What matters is you preserve a mature and friendly attitude. Keep an open mind, follow the general etiquette
      and there shall be no drama!
    </li>

    <li><span>Decent amount of communication:</span> We expect you to engage with the guild chat, in-game and/or
      on
      here. Say a
      simple hi/bye, feel free to ask/answer questions and just chat with us. No one will bite!
    </li>

    <li><span>Fair amount of representation:</span> There are no percentages to meet with representation, we just
      want you to be
      fair. If this guild provides you good time, give something back with a simple click.
    </li>

    <li><span>Consistent activity and participation:</span> To not end up running a graveyard, we cleanup inactive
      members
      periodically. We also don't do lots of events every day and expect you to join them all but when we do
      organize things, we'd like to see you there!
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><span>It is really important that you can satisfy at least 2 of those expectations,
      while maturity and friendliness is a must!</span>
